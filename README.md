Data Collection:

The data collection for this project began with using openpaymentsdata.cms.gov website. The link [https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/dataset/df01c2f8-dc1f-4e79-96cb-8208beaf143c] is where I begin collecting only data centered on Texas. Set the filter to have "Recipient_State" contains TX to reduce the dataset to be more manageable. [Insert Screenshot]. This was done due to the sheer size of the 2022 General Payment Dataset having at least 13 million data values. The raw dataset still turned out to have 1250000 data points. For GitHub size limits, repository has a limit of 1 GB. The size turned out to about 7 GBs. 

After downloading the csv files, I filtered out the raw data into 7 tables. Unfortunately uploading all of the files here are too big to be displayed on GitHub even after picking out the relevant columns to be used before data cleaning and data visualizations.
